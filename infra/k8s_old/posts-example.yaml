apiVersion: v1

# Type of object we want to create
kind: Pod

# Config options for the object we are about to create
metadata:
  # We can use whatever name we want
  name: posts

# the exact attibutes we want to apply to object
spec:
  # We can create multiple containers inside a single pod
  containers:
    # We can use whatever name we want
    - name: posts
    # If you not specify a version, "latest" will be user. Is good practice (and safer) to add version allways.
